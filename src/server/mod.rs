//! This module contains the definitions for the Lobby and Player structs, as well as the implementation of the game state machine.
//! 
//! The Lobby struct represents a game lobby, which can contain multiple players. It manages the game state and player interactions.
//! 
//! The Player struct represents a player in the game. It contains the player's name, hand, wallet balance, and other attributes.
//! 
//! The game state machine is implemented as a series of async functions that handle the game logic, such as dealing cards, betting rounds, and showdowns.
//! 
//! The game state machine is driven by player input, which is received via WebSocket messages. The game state machine processes the input and sends messages back to the players.
